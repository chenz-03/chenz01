- When we first **encounter obstacles**, it's crucial to **maintain a positive outlook**. Emotions play a significant role in this process, which **can be viewed as** an experiment. Here's how it unfolds:
	- **External events** enter our consciousness.
	- We form our own perspectives on these events.
	- These perspectives trigger our nervous system.
	- Finally, emotions arise in response to the situation.
- ==In my opinion, while we cannot choose the obstacles we face, we can change our perspective towards them.== Emotions are not inherently negative; they can be helpful or harmful depending on how we manage them. It's essential to understand that maintaining happiness is not the only goal. Instead, we should focus on cultivating a healthy emotional cycle.
- So, how can we rationally manage our emotions? I believe that emotions are a resource that require attention and management. When we feel depressed or anxious, it's important to identify the cause of these feelings and then encourage ourselves. ==We should practice patience to develop a positive emotional response.==
- ==Moreover, it's a misconception that we should always strive to be happy.== ==Emotions like sadness or frustration can be useful tools for relating to others==. For example, when a close friend experiences a breakup, their sadness and frustration can resonate with us, prompting empathy and support.
- ==Today, many people suffer from depression and anxiety, and an increasing number face emotional challenges==. Some may try to avoid ==these emotions==, ==seeking a positive environment and energy==. ==However, I believe that== ==there's more than one way to gain== energy and change our perspective on the world. It's not about escaping these feelings but learning to manage them effectively.
